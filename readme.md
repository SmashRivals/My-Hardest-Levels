# Welcome to the maintained Geometry Dash Shitty List repo!
---
There isnt much going on here at the moment but the list team will actively be adding new records and levels, so keep an eye out on the [website](https://gdshittylist.asemnada991.repl.co/).

# FAQ
---
I want to update a record. How can I do that?
- You can always update your record through [the shitty list website](https://gdshittylist.asemnada991.repl.co/).

Can I use the Shitty List template?
- I mean, sure. just make sure you give credit somewhere and make sure you state that you're not affiliated with the shitty list.

The website isnt loading! What can I do?
- since no webhost is perfect, downtime is expected. you can either wait til the website is back online or you can do some behind the theme stuff and run it locally.

More Coming Soon!
